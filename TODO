TODO list for Perl module DateTime::Event::Random

Options:
    truncate_to => 'days'

How to obtain shuffled datetimes?

Make class functions such as:
    rand_datetime()
    rand_duration()
    rand_datetime_in_span()

Find out some links about the "density function"

Documented problems - from the POD:

Note that, although the datetime values are random,
the accessors (C<as_list>, C<iterator/next/previous>) always 
return sorted datetimes.

The module calculates all intervals in seconds, which may give
a 32-bit integer overflow if you ask for a density less than
about "1 occurence in each 30 years" - that is, about a billion seconds.
This may change in a next version.
