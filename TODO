How to obtain shuffled datetimes?

duration() parameters - minimum, maximum size

Find out some links about the "density function"

Implement other random distributions

Optimize new_cached()

random_datetime parameters - locale, time_zone

Documented problems - from the POD:

Note that, although the datetime values are random,
the accessors (C<as_list>, C<iterator/next/previous>) always 
return sorted datetimes.

The "set" routines calculate all intervals in seconds, which may give
a 32-bit integer overflow if you ask for a density less than
about "1 occurence in each 30 years" - that is, about a billion seconds.
This may change in a next version.
